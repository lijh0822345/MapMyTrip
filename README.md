本项目旨在为用户提供旅游地的热门景点信息、智能路线规划和交互式地图可视化功能。 
使用方法： 
①输入旅游城市，可返回该区域热门景点，提前了解景点分布情况，便于规划居住位置。 
②输入起点和终点（如酒店，高铁站等），如有途经点（如景点或其它）可通过点击地图或输入地名设置，自动规划出相应路线。 
本项目主要使用OpenLayers和高德地图API进行开发，目前仅为demo阶段，后续将进一步完善功能。
Introduction
This project is designed to provide users with information about popular tourist attractions, smart route planning, and interactive map visualization. It aims to help travelers explore destinations more efficiently and plan their trips in advance.
Usage
①Search by city: Enter a city name to retrieve a list of popular attractions in the area. This helps users understand the distribution of attractions and plan accommodation accordingly.
②Route planning: Enter a starting point and a destination (e.g., hotel, railway station). If needed, add waypoints (such as attractions or other places) by clicking on the map or entering their names. The system will automatically generate an optimized route.
Technology Stack
OpenLayers: for interactive map display and visualization
AMap (Gaode) API: for location, attraction data, and route planning services
Project Status
This project is currently at the demo stage and will be further improved in the future.
