　　由于现有平台没有专门用于对多个旅游景点进行直接快速导航功能，因此每次出游都得先到小红书、抖音等平台搜集旅游地热门景点信息，再到高德地图、百度地图等平台逐个定位，用于提前规划所住酒店，最后到了旅游地还需要逐个景点导航，操作较为繁琐。  
　　因此，本项目旨在为用户提供旅游地的热门景点分布、智能路线规划和交互式地图可视化功能，帮助用户快速了解旅游地热门景点分布情况，以提前规划居住区域。本项目主要使用OpenLayers和高德地图API进行开发，目前仅为demo阶段，后续将进一步完善功能。
## 使用方法： 
* 输入旅游城市，可返回该区域热门景点分布情况，便于规划居住位置。 
* 输入起点和终点（如酒店，高铁站等），如有途经点（如景点或其它）可通过点击地图或输入地名设置，自动规划出相应路线。

## Introduction
　　At present, there isn’t a platform that allows users to quickly navigate between multiple tourist attractions directly. As a result, travelers usually have to search for popular attractions on platforms like Xiaohongshu or TikTok, then locate each spot one by one on map services such as AMap or Baidu Maps to plan where to stay. When they finally arrive at the destination, they still need to navigate to each attraction separately — a rather time-consuming process.  
　　This project aims to provide users with an integrated solution that displays popular attractions, offers smart route planning, and supports interactive map visualization. It helps users quickly understand the spatial distribution of attractions in a tourist area, making it easier to plan accommodations and travel routes in advance.  
## Usage
* Search by city: Enter a city name to retrieve a list of popular attractions in the area. This helps users understand the distribution of attractions and plan accommodation accordingly.
* Route planning: Enter a starting point and a destination (e.g., hotel, railway station). If needed, add waypoints (such as attractions or other places) by clicking on the map or entering their names. The system will automatically generate an optimized route.
## Technology Stack
* OpenLayers: for interactive map display and visualization
* AMap (Gaode) API: for location, attraction data, and route planning services
## Project Status
　　This project is currently at the demo stage and will be further improved in the future.
